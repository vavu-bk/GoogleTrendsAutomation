Quick instructions to get up and running. 

### What is this repository for? ###

Pulling interest data from Google Trends using the Pytrends API, and consequently updating our Google Trends Dashboard. 

### How do I get set up? ###

Make a clone to pull the repository to your local environment, and run the weekly_pull.py script with the date ranges adjusted to the time period you want to pull for.
Do NOT run daily_pull.py as the script is outdated and is used solely for testing purposes.
